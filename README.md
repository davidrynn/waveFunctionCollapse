#  Wave Function Collapse Demo

After watching a video by [the CodingTrain on youtube about Wave Function Collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM), I decided to implement the algorithm in SwiftUI.  I could see a lot of uses for the algorithm in various projects I'm interest in.  I was able to simplify and "swiftify" a lot of the code.

# Organization
I decided not to use MVVM exactly.  Instead I abstracted the logic in to a Logic class that is passed around as an enviromental object.
